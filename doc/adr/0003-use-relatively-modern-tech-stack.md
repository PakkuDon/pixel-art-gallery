# 3. Use relatively modern tech stack

Date: 2020-11-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This application only has two functions:

- Display past pixel art entries
- Display details for selected pixel art entry

But as a side project this is a space where I can over-engineer things, both to experiment with new technologies and techniques and to either wow or scare off friends, family, colleagues, potential recruiters and anyone else who may stumble across this repo.

## Decision

This project will leverage the following technologies:

- React.js
- PostCSS
- Webpack
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Cypress

## Consequences

- As this will introduce new dependencies there will be some effort required in making sure that we're on top of any security alerts
