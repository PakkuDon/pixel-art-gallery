      Palette: Sampled from a past press conference: #490172, #D8C8E3, 
      #F9F9FE, #000000, #262926, #797977, #C8C7D1, #EDC4A6

      With today's press conference came the announcement that the border between 
      Metro and Regional Victoria along with the 25km travel limit will be lifted from 
      11:59 PM tonight as Victoria recorded its ninth consecutive day of zero 
      new coronavirus cases and no deaths. 
      
      We also bid farewell to the signature purple wall which had been a 
      feature across Daniel Andrews' 120 consecutive press conferences. 
      The wall which bore the words "Staying Apart Keeps Us Together"
      has now been replaced with another saying "Stay Safe, Stay Open"
